# JSX Spec Link
[JSX (facebook.github.io)](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)

> JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics. It's NOT intended to be implemented by engines or browsers. **It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the ECMAScript spec itself.** It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript.


If you go to TS Playgoorund, you will get this, which is giving the wrong impression of JSX is same as react. We know, Solid, Qwik and new frameworks implement JSX spec, hence, React !== JSX

Hyperscript is not performant as the used inside-out approach. 
Solid (and other libs) do not use this.
